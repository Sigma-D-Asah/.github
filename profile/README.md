### Objectives 
Sigma-D aims to deliver an intelligent system capable of:  
- **Detecting anomalies** from machine sensor data and **predicting potential failures** such as overheating, vibration anomalies, or bearing damage.  
- **Providing automated maintenance recommendations** derived from AI inference results that can be directly acted upon by engineers.  
- **Offering an interactive dashboard** that displays real-time asset condition insights, complete with model explainability for transparent and trustworthy decision-making.  
- **Introducing an Agentic Copilot** that supports natural language queriesâ€”allowing engineers to interact through a chatbot interface to generate integrated insights and recommended actions instantly.
